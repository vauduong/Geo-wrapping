# Geo-wrapping
Inspired by the iconic ”Spider and Fly” problem in mathematics, this paper attempts
to answer the question, ”What happens if the spider kept crawling?” The
question can be visualized as string wrapping around 3-dimensional objects, and
was therefore given the name ”Geo-wrapping”. Properties of line-continuation
on a net were observed, a python turtle program was written to model the
problem for a cube, and a generalization of the problem for different solids was
attempted.
